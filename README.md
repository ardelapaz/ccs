This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## CCS - Cyberathelete Championship Series

This is a project site for the players of CCS to allow for a formal interface between the staff and the players.

## Goal of the website

The goal of this site is to replace the unformal private message system this league runs on by allowing for members of the league to create accounts and manage their team through an all inclusive website. Users will be able to manage their team and their info while being able to see realtime schedule updates and announcements, giving a UI to the discord ran league.
